**Introduction to Iris Flowers Classification ML Project**
This project is an excellent entry point into Machine Learning, often referred to as the "Hello World" of ML. The Iris Flowers dataset, a classic in the field, is perfect for beginners as it offers a simple introduction to supervised ML algorithms. The dataset consists of numeric attributes, making it easy to work with, and its small size allows for easy loading into memory without requiring complex transformations or scaling.

**Dataset Overview**
The Iris Flowers dataset includes samples from three species of iris flowers, each with four features: sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width. The objective is to classify each instance into one of the three species based on these features.
